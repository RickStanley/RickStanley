I like to explore new fields of computer science, above all Web Technologies. Same thing with languages. I've worked with headless CMS, serveless apps, WebApps, nodejs etc (just a bunch buzz words, but you get the idea) as full stack developer, with tools like AWS, Docker, Git, Mocha and more. Most of these tools I've learned how to use by myself, to work for a living.

I'm looking to collaborate on [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno/) on the Rust side of things, but right now I'm novice of rustland.

Some Websites that I've worked on:

- [CoCASA Coworking + Costudying](https://www.cocasa.com.br/)
- [Eu Sou S√≥cio - Manaus F.C.](https://eusousocio.com.br/)
- [Eu Sou S√≥cio - Manaus F.C. APP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eusousocio.manausfc&hl=pt)
- [ARCo Assinatura de Caf√©s](http://assinearco.com.br/)
- [Portal Marcos Santos](https://www.portalmarcossantos.com.br/)
- [Jambucana](https://compra.jambucana.com.br/)
